# Garmin Instinct 2S Review

I recently replaced my last smartwatch, a Garmin VivoSmart 4, which I had for three years. It was starting to look a bit worn out, but I didn't have a real need to replace it until now.

Today, I ordered a Garmin Instinct 2S in search of a meaningful and simple smartwatch in this age of tech overload.

The reason I've stuck with the Garmin brand is that the measurements and reliability are just top-notch. I've had experiences with Xiaomi smartwatches, but the features and precision are not on par with Garmin. Heart rate and sleep states are measured with precision on the Garmin, whereas they are just so-so on the Xiaomi. Xiaomi does have an advantage in that it offers an OLED display, which is very affordable.

Another great feature that not even the Apple Watch offers is the Body Battery indicator. It shows rather accurately how much energy you have available during the day.
