# The Path

Claudius: I thank you, dear friends, for **wanting to walk the path** that leads you to knowledge. I want you to comprehend and understand, to feel and sense. It is not necessarily our intention that you acquire this knowledge through reason, according to the spoken word. It is much more important that you use the word only as a tool to allow certainty and conviction to grow in your soul.

The concepts, my dear friends, that have been mentioned to you should make you aware that **everything in the universe is love—everything—the highest energy: GOD**.

But my friends, everything is also in interaction with each other, which means: How can this love, this God, be felt? There must be a counterpart to it. This counterpart, my friends, is the **consciousness of the soul**, so that it can feel this love, this

**I am love**.

This first.
**Soul**, my friends, is a definition to help you understand what your **dual** is. Soul, my friends, is **spirit body** – it is spirit matter, because it can condense, condense to such an extent that it is like a breath, like a veil or like a **dual body of matter**. Friends, we will return to this mystery again and again in the course of our conversations.

The radiation of a stone also has something to do with this. The spirit of matter contains a partial consciousness, the partial consciousness of the molecular structure of the object in question.

Understand it this way: your body, which is inanimate, the stone, which is of course inanimate, nevertheless carries the information of the molecular structure within itself. This means nothing other than that the body, in the broadest sense, the material body, is composed of molecular structures. Thus, a partial knowledge that is present in this molecular structure has formed this body.

However, this body is only conscious of itself, that is, it does not perceive itself, but IT IS. When I speak of the spirit of matter, I mean that the molecular structure contains the knowledge that it becomes stone, that it becomes a tree, or a human body, without conscious being. Now, spirit matter is something else: spirit matter forms the container of the soul.
Love is always, love is God, is the primordial energy.
Behold, the idea of "human being" was present in this spiritual structure; the idea of human being was born at the moment when the I AM, namely the connection between love, spirit, and soul, was formed.

This was a mental structure that created the image of "human," and this image of human was projected onto this planet.

An interaction developed. These beings, and now I am deliberately referring to the soul, you could also say angelic beings, who felt this I AM in love, harbored it within themselves, took on condensed forms when they encountered this planet.

This refers to the condensed idea of human beings, who **were free from any material ties** – at first. They lived for 500, 600, 700 years before they could dissolve again. Only at the moment when they began to change their original information, their molecular structure, **did they become physical**. This physicality bound them to this planet, to matter. There were beings that could be described as human beings in the broadest sense of the word, because the idea was present. Perfection was achieved over the course of **millennia**.

In the past, people kept stumbling over this question: "Yes, how did human beings come into being, how can humanity be understood at all?"
This question has been a recurring theme in our discussions over the last few years. I have told you that God is not to be questioned, and in many cases this is still the decisive question in the subconscious today.

You will feel this decisive question when you cross the river. It is too high for humans to be able to convey this to them. The only important thing is that you understand what happened when man became human, when man gained consciousness, when he was able to recognize himself as human, because the moment he becomes aware of his creation, he also becomes aware of a creator, an imaginary, incomprehensible creator. Once humans understand, beyond reason, that nothing happens without causing a cause and effect, they naturally question it—and reason is nothing more than the controlling factor that enables them to think, send out energies, and let influences in.

Each of you in this circle, each spirit energy in this circle communicates constantly with each other. It forms a conglomerate that leads—and you should recognize this as something special—to one person conveying impulses to another, tangible, palpable impulses that sometimes also lead to arguments.

However, these arguments that are had bind them even closer together and do not repel them. This is the great advantage within a family – and here I do not mean the family that is formed before the registry office or the church – but I mean the family of like-minded energies. Reason, as a controlling factor of the brain, can be described as insensitive, if you will. It controls thoughts. It is a source of energy, and so it is up to each individual to listen to their soul or to their rational mind, which initially forbids them from entering this circle, because then their relationship to the environment changes to a different degree than when they are in this circle.
You can feel the changes that have taken place in the people who belong to this circle.

Question: It is very nice to see this development, and I think that when I make the transition, I will do so consciously this time, which was certainly not the case in previous lives or transitions. 

Claudius: That is exactly right, my dear. And one more thing: the dialogues will only gain their greatest significance when the people involved have become wise – and when our friend is no longer bound to the human body. You see, it is strange in human life. All the impulses that a person receives in the course of their life are initially absorbed – but they are only valued when the impulses diminish.

Then the human spirit must grapple with all the accumulated potential of knowledge, experience, and feeling, and then many things that were hidden in the veil of the future will emerge. One will be able to comprehend and understand because one has been freed from the **material constraints of human existence**.
